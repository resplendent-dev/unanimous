# Contributing

## Code of Conduct

Please note we have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it
in all your interactions with the project.

## Member Responsibilities

First things first, the module_goes_here community welcomes all contributors with
good intentions and we will as much as possible respect your efforts to
contribute. Specifically we will try and request changes where required and as
last resort make changes on top of pull requests leaving your work with due
acknowledgement. We will specifically avoid finding some fault with your code
and then submit a similar pull request that contains little acknowledgement of
the original work.

## Contributor Responsibilities

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. Contributing
to this repository is greatly welcomed and the process is to save everyone time to make contributions
efficient rather than be a challenge to overcome.


## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of significant changes.
2. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one other developer, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.
